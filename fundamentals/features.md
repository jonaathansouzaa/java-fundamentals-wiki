# Java Features

## Simple

Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun, Java language is a simple programming language because:
   * Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
   * Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
   * There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.

## Object-Oriented

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.

Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

## Portable / Platform independent

Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.

The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on the top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:

Runtime Environment
API(Application Programming Interface)
Java code can be run on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).

## Secured

Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
**_No explicit pointer_** 
**_Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox_**

* Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.
* Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right to objects.
* Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application developer explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.
